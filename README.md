# Ruby Exercise Template

This is a blank project you can use to craft your own Ruby projects for exercises
and assessments.

#### Gems

It only comes with the 'rspec' gem for testing. It also comes with files that
set the ruby version and the gemset. Once you pull down this project once, and
bundle gems, you shouldn't have to do it again. Your computer should just know
which Ruby and gemset to use.

## Getting Started

1. `bundle` to get your gems
2. Follow the tests to write your class logic
